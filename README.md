# TextTiler

TextTiler is a really basic program that converts a pixel tile map into a text tile map based on the colors and characters you selected in the unity editor.

I was able to build this tool thanks to the Unity Standalone File Browser asset: [https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser](https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser)
